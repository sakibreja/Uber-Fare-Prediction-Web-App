# Uber-Fare-Prediction-Web-App
Uber Fare Prediction Web App
Role: Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer
Purpose: Developed a predictive model and an interactive web application to estimate Uber ride fares based on pickup/drop-off coordinates, distance, and passenger count.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Pickle, Haversine Formula
Key Contributions:
•	Built a machine learning model to predict Uber fares using real-world ride data.
•	Implemented feature engineering techniques, including distance calculation using the Haversine formula.
•	Developed a Streamlit-based web app for real-time user interaction and fare estimation.
•	Optimized model performance and integrated it into the app using a serialized .pkl file.
Impact: Provided a user-friendly tool for estimating Uber fares, enhancing transparency for riders and enabling better trip cost planning.
